//Whenever you need to work with data and passing it b/n view controllers always put it in a struct or a class, never pass around multiple variables between view controllers

//use implicitly unwrapped optionals i.e. what is below with the ! mark when you can guarantee variable will have data in it before being used
//use optionals with a ? mark when there may or may not be data in the variable at runtime
